## Advanced DataVisualization with ggplot - Themes

Themes controll all non-data ink information for the plots.
These are all visual elements, not part of the data representation, and they consist of three parts:

- text
- line
- rectangle

They are accessed by a standard nameing convention in ggplot:

- element_text()
- element_line()
- element_rectangle()


## First we look at the visual elements
```{r}
iris.wide
```
